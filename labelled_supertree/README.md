# labelled_supertree

Requires that otcetera tools be in your PATH.

Two artifacts:
 * `labelled_supertree.tre`: A newick tree file containing a single tree. Labels are ottid
 * `labelled_supertree_ottnames.tre`: This is the same tree as `labelled_supertree.tre` but more friendly to tree viewers. Monotypic nodes have been removed and Labels are 'ottname ottid'.

This tools currently just adds names for unnamed nodes in the tree.

<p>The <em>cleaned_ott</em> directory contains the results of pruning OTT
version ${cleaned_ott.version} so that the root is
<a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse?id=${cleaned_ott.root_ott_id}">${cleaned_ott.root_ott_id}</a>
and the taxa flagged with the following flags were removed:</p>
<ul>
    <li tal:repeat="flag cleaned_ott.flags_to_prune" tal:content="flag" />
</ul>

<strong>Next step: </strong>Bump extinct taxa higher in the taxonomy, if necessary so that moving an extinct taxon does not disrupt the phylogenetic naming later in the pipeline.
<a href="../bumped_ott/index.html">../bumped_ott/index.html</a>.

<p><strong>Results: </strong>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./cleaning_flags.txt">cleaning_flags.txt</a> holds the flags that signal that taxon shoule be pruned from the taaxonomy before synthesis (this is one aspect of the configuration, serialized here for convenience).</li>
  <li><a href="./cleaned_ott.json">cleaned_ott.json</a> is a JSON summary (often a large file that can be hard to look at in a browser) that lists the reasons different taxa were pruned. The file is composed from 
  3 different files (which are rarely of direct interest to end-users): 
  <a href="./flagged_in_cleaned.json">flagged_in_cleaned.json</a>, 
  <a href="./cleaned_ott_pruned_nonflagged.json">cleaned_ott_pruned_nonflagged.json</a>, and
  <a href="./cleaned_ott_1.json">cleaned_ott_1.json</a>.
  The following table summarizes the information in  <strong>cleaned_ott.json</strong> by
  showing the number of OTT IDs pruned by the combination of
  flags that caused the pruning (we don't list each of the OTT ID here because
  the list is extremely long and can make your browser hang.):
<table>
    <tr><th>Combination of flags</th><th># of nodes pruned</th></tr>
    <tr tal:repeat="id_eblob cleaned_ott.pruned.items()">
        <td>${id_eblob[0]}</td>
        <div tal:switch="id_eblob[0] in cleaned_ott.pruning_keys_not_from_flags">
            <td tal:case="True">${'{:,}'.format(len(id_eblob[1]))}</td>
            <td tal:case="False">${'{:,}'.format(len(id_eblob[1]['anc_ott_id_pruned']))}</td>
        </div>
    </tr>
</table>
  </li>
  <li><a href="./cleaned_not_updated_ott.tre">cleaned_not_updated_ott.tre</a> is a
newick representation of the taxonomy with a total of ${'{:,}'.format(cleaned_ott.num_nodes)} nodes.
${'{:,}'.format(cleaned_ott.num_tips)} of these are leaves and
${'{:,}'.format(cleaned_ott.num_non_leaf_nodes)} internal nodes.</li>
  <li><a href="./cleaned_ott_with_hiddenbarren.tre">cleaned_ott_with_hiddenbarren.tre</a> is another representation of the taxonomic tree. This file contains higher taxa that lack descendants. Such taxa are pruned from the cleaned_not_updated_ott.tre form.</li>
<li><a href="./move_extinct_higher_log.json">move_extinct_higher_log.json</a> is a file that 
  summarizes a check of whether or not some of the extinct taxa should be moved rootward (higher)
  in the taxonomy. If their is an "edits" property in this file, then the <a href="../bumped_ott/index.html">../bumped_ott</a> directory will hold a modified version of the taxonomy.</li>
  <li><a href="./ott_version.txt">ott_version.txt</a> holds the ID for the canonical OTT version used as an input to the synthesis</li>
  <li><a href="./root_ott_id.txt">root_ott_id.txt</a> holds the root OTT ID (copy of info in other directories just for convenience).</li>

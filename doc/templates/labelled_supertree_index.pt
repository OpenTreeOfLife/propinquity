<p>This directory holds the solution tree reattaching the parts of the taxonomy (from <a href="../cleaned_ott/index.html">../cleaned_ott/index.html</a>)
    which
    were not covered by any input tree to the grafted solution (see <a href="../grafted_solution/index.html">../grafted_solution/index.html</a>).</p>
<p>The input grafted solution had ${unprune_stats.input["num_solution_leaves"]} leaves and
    ${unprune_stats.input["num_solution_splits"]} forking nodes 
    (and ${unprune_stats.input["num_solution_internals"] - unprune_stats.input["num_solution_splits"]} monotypic nodes).</p>
<p>The input cleaned taxonomy had ${unprune_stats.input["num_taxonomy_leaves"]} leaves and
    ${unprune_stats.input["num_taxonomy_splits"]} forking nodes 
    (and ${unprune_stats.input["num_taxonomy_internals"] - unprune_stats.input["num_taxonomy_splits"]} monotypic nodes).</p>
<p>${unprune_stats.output["num_leaves_added"]} leaves were added to create the solution.
    ${unprune_stats.output["num_taxa_rejected"]} taxa were rejected.</p>
<p>The files of interest in this directory are:
<ul>
    <li>the <a href="./labelled_supertree.tre">./labelled_supertree.tre</a> (full solution with names created for non-taxonomic internal nodes).</li>
    <li>the <a href="./broken_taxa.json">./broken_taxa.json</a> which describes who
    members of non-monophyletic taxa are spread across the tree.</li>
    <li>the <a href="./input_output_stats.json">./input_output_stats.json</a> which describes the
    size of the tree before and after unpruning the taxonomic content.</li>
    <li>the <a href="./labelled_supertree_out_degree_distribution.txt">./labelled_supertree_out_degree_distribution.txt</a> shows the out-degree frequency distribution
    for the nodes in the labelled supertree</li>
</ul>

<p>The next step is to reattach the taxa that were not present in any phylogenetic estimated; See <a href="../grafted_solution/index.html">../grafted_solution/index.html</a></p>
<p>Sorted by the number of tips then by the number of internal nodes, these are:</p>

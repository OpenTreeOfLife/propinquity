<p>Propinquity output documentation. The top-level docs are <a href="../index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>This directory holds the results of the last step of the input preprocessing for the
    supertree pipeline.
All of the leaves in these trees are mapped to terminal taxa in the taxonomy.
This is accomplished by taking the cleaned input trees (see 
<a href="../cleaned_phylo/index.html">../cleaned_phylo/index.html</a> and 
<a href="../cleaned_ott/index.html">../cleaned_ott/index.html</a>) and choosing
exemplar taxa to represent at for each tip that is mapped to a non-terminal taxon.</p>

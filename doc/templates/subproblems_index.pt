<p>The <em>subproblems</em> directory holds the ${len(subproblems.tree_files)}
subproblems. Each one is a slice of the full tree. They do not overlap.
The decomposition is produced
    by identifying each higher taxon that is not contested by any single
    phylogenetic input.
This taxon becomes the root of the subproblem (and is used in the file name to
identify the subproblem).
Many of the subproblems contain only trivial phylogenetic statements.
See <a href="https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/propinquity/blob/master/subproblems/README.md" target="_blank">the subproblems README</a> for details on the procedure.

<p><strong>Next step: </strong>Solving the subproblems. See
<a href="../subproblem_solutions/index.html">../subproblem_solutions/index.html</a>
for details.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong>
This page contains the <a href="#subproblems">list of subproblems</a>, the
<a href="#trees">list of subproblems overlapping each input tree</a>, and the
<a href="#broken">list of contested ('broken') taxa</a>.

<p id="subproblems"><strong>List of subproblems</strong></p>

Each of the ${len(subproblems.tree_files)}
subproblems is a list of trees (in newick
representation) with the order reflecting the ranking of the input trees.
The taxonomy overlaps with every subproblem.</p>
<p>Sorted by the number of phylogenetic inputs, the subproblems are:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Subproblem</th><th># inputs</th><th># tips</th><th>Input Identifiers</th></tr>
    <tr tal:repeat="id_src_el subproblems.sorted_by_num_phylo_inputs">
        <td><a href="./${id_src_el[0]}">${id_src_el[0]}</a></td>
        <td>${len(id_src_el[1])}</td>
        <td>${id_src_el[2]}</td>
        <td>${', '.join(id_src_el[1])}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p id="trees"><strong>Overlap between trees and subproblems</strong></p>

<p>The list of input phylogenetic trees sorted by the number of subproblems that they overlap with is:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Study+Tree key</th><th># subproblems</th><th>Subproblem Identifiers</th></tr>
    <tr tal:repeat="inp_sub_l subproblems.input_and_subproblems_sorted">
        <td>${inp_sub_l[0]}</td>
        <td>${len(inp_sub_l[1])}</td>
        <td>${', '.join(inp_sub_l[1])}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p id="broken"><strong>Contested taxa</strong></p>

<p>The ${len(subproblems.contested_taxa)} contested taxa follow. For each taxon,
  we list the input tree(s) that conflict with the taxon. For each tree,
the "parent nodes" are internal nodes each of which has
at least 1 child that belongs entirely to the taxon
and at least one descendant that does not belong in the taxon. If the OTT Id were
not contested, there would only be one internal node that fit those criterion, but
in contested taxa there are multiple.</p>
